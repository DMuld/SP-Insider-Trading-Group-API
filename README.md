# SP-Insider-Trading-Group-API
Team project backend code.


Need to have Maven installed. It might just work in Eclipse, I am using Intellij. 

This is using Maven, command that I use to start that is "mvn sprint-boot:run"

## Info
This sets up API endpoints that are used to communicate to the front-end of the project. 

This back-end also parses government websites to get all the transactional data about the trades. 

This was hosted on AWS Ec2 Instance
